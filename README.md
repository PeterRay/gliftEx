# gliftEx : Generic, Efficient Random-Access GPU Data Structures 

The intent of gliftEx is the implementation of the original Lefohn's project "glift" as open source.

A brief introduction is to think the library like a Standard Template Library that implements Vectors (for example)
that are not allocated in CPU memory but instead in GPU memory, allowing parallel processing like GPU's can do.
